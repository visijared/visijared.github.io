						<h2>Myth. &nbsp Legend. &nbsp Fairy Tale.</h2>
						<span class="byline">
							<b>What's the difference?</b>
						</span>
					</header>
					<span style="font-size:x-large">
						The categories of myth, legend and folktale have commonly been used as synonymous terms, however, each have a style of their own. &nbsp The misconception is understandable as they do share several characteristics, however they each have unique traits. 
						<p></p>Common attributes found amongst myths, legends and folklore are to blame for the common generalization. &nbsp All of them begin as stories told orally and passed down, changing over time, from generation to generation. &nbsp Each has elements of a traditional story including a plot. 
						<p></p><b>Myths</b> are unique because they deal primarily with supernatural entities acting as the primary characters. &nbsp Secondary characters are often humans. &nbsp In a myth, time is not easy to measure. &nbsp Often the story takes place outside of human chronology, although it may loosely entwine elements of history. &nbsp The predominant intention of a myth is to provide an extraordinary explanation for unexplained naturally occurring events. &nbsp People use myths to explain what they do not know. &nbsp They also pass cultural values on through their morals. &nbsp Myths tackle issues concerned with the human-supernatural relationship. 
						<p></p><b>Legends</b> deserve their own category because their primary characters are human heroes and heroines. &nbsp These heroes and heroines are typically formed from the same blueprint. &nbsp They are typically aristocrats who have a hindering weakness. &nbsp They may also have secondary supernatural characteristics. &nbsp They take place in the distant past, in places that either are real or resemble to be. &nbsp Legends tell of events in human past that justify the present state of man, containing a definite element of history. &nbsp They are typically stories of great accomplishments that relate to the modern world. 
						<p></p><b>Fairy Tales</b> deal with primary characters that are ordinary people or anthropomorphic creatures. &nbsp The main character is often an outcast in the beginning who changes greatly at the end. &nbsp They take place in an imaginary setting, including the place in time, which is irrelevant to the story. &nbsp They are devised to entertain but also include morals and lessons in order to reinforce behavior. &nbsp Fairy Tales are commonly called folktales, fables, or tall-tales and involve fortune reversals and happy endings.
