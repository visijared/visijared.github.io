								<h3><a href="http://www.gutenberg.ca/" target="_blank">Save our Public Domain!</a></h3>
							</header>
							<h4>
								<p></p>In the beginning of 2015, Ian Fleming's character <b>James Bond</b> and his entire body of fiction entered the Canadian public domain... and was promptly removed again.
								<p></p>Canadians now have to wait another <b>20 years</b>.
								<p></p>Why?
								<p></p>Bill C-59 had its first reading on May 7, 2015. The Bill includes a stealth proposal that extends the copyright terms from end-of-life+50 years to end-of-life+70 years.
								<p></p>This means there will be no new work released to the public domain for another 20 years.
								<p></p>These new laws are being quietly pushed into place as a measure to appease the European Union and U.S., who have end-of-life+70 copyright terms and have pretty much demanded Canada follow suit.
								<p></p>Our Conservative Government has caved without even letting the Canadian public know of the changes being made, let alone involving them in the decision-making process.
								<p></p>While the media has covered the impact these new laws will have on recording artists, they have failed to properly convey how many written works will also be affected.
								<p></p>If you feel like the Canadian people should have been communicated to regarding our public domain copyright terms, please click on 
								<a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/SenatorsMembers.aspx?Language=ehttp://www.parl.gc.ca/SenatorsMembers.aspx?Language=e" target="_blank">THIS LINK</a> to contact your local MP directly.

								<h2>The Great Folklorist of Canada</h2>
								<span class="byline">
									England had William Thoms and Eric Maple.   <br>Russia had Alexander Afanasyev and Vladimir Propp.   <br>Switzerland had Carl Jung.   <br>Germany had the Brothers Grimm.<br><br><b>Canada had Cyrus MacMillan.</b>

							Cyrus MacMillan was born 1882 in Wood Islands, PEI.  He was a very educated man.  In his lifetime, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Masters of Arts degree 
							from McGill University, as well as a Ph.D from Harvard.

									<h3>War Hero</h3>
								</header>
								<p></p>He also fought in World War I with the 7th Canadian Siege Battery.
								<p></p>In his own words, <strong>"It is perhaps but fair to explain that the proofs were corrected by the writer in the intervals between other duties on Vimy Ridge, France, and that to this fact and the consequent haste any minor errors may in part at least be attributed..."</strong>
								<p></p>
								<p></p>Indeed. Nothing like a pesky world war to give you minor publishing errors.

									<h3>Politician, Dean, Scholar</h3>
								</header>
								<p></p>He taught at McGill as Chairman of the English department.  He was later Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science.		
								<p></p>This led to a political career that saw him as the Minister of Fisheries, House of Commons member, and Parliamentary Assistant to the Minsiter of National Defence for Air until his death in 1953.

									<h3>Mimicked Grimm Brothers' Approach</h3>
								</header>
								<p></p>Having read and admired the work of the Brothers Grimm, Cyrus MacMillan decided to travel across Canada and collect every myth, tall tale, fable and the rest by word of mouth from live orators.  He believed this was the only way to accurately document the oral traditions of Canada's most remote denizens.		
								<p></p><strong>"The author's method resembles that followed by the brothers Grimm a century ago. He has taken down from the lips of living people, pretty much 
								as they were given to him, a series of stories which obviously contain many elements that have been handed down by oral tradition from some far-off past."</strong>

							<Section>
								Robert Houle is a contemporary artist, curator, and critic who has played a significant role in the recovery of aboriginal heritage. 
								He draws on Western art conventions to tackle lingering aspects of European colonization of First Nations people. 
								<p></p>He relies on the objectivity of Modernism and the subjectivity of a postmodernism to bring text and photographic documents into his work.
								<p></p>During his formative years Houle was immersed in native spiritual practices and was influenced by Catholicism. 
								The dual experiences of these traditions are present in his work where native symbols and ritual objects are combined with Western sculptural and painting techniques. 
								<p></p>Houle studied art history at the University of Manitoba, and graduated from McGill University in Montreal with a degree in art education. 
								He has been exhibiting in group and solo shows since the mid-1970's. He was the curator of Contemporary Indian Art at the Canadian Museum of Civilization from 1977 to 1980. 
								<p></p>During his tenure, he opposed the relegation of contemporary Native art to anthropological or ethnographic artifact. 
								This experience resulted in his introducing themes of Native ceremonial objects into his art, such as the parflèche, or medicine bag, and the warrior spear and shield.
